### Dear Self,

I've been reflecting on some categories that I believe will provide a good understanding of myself:

#### Find Purpose:
- **Identify your values and what truly matters to you.**

I've realized that I'm not entirely certain about my values or what truly matters to me. I hesitate to claim I have ethics, kindness, or any other virtues because I don't want to boast. However, I've noticed a recurring pattern in my life where I make mistakes, regret them, and then repeat them. This cycle weighs heavily on me, wasting my time, effort, health, determination, and dreams. It drains me of positive energy, leading to decreased productivity, depression, and a lack of passion. In short, I struggle to define my values. As for what truly matters to me, I care deeply for my family. I want to succeed on my terms, overcome past struggles, improve our quality of life, and live without constraints.

#### Set Meaningful Goals:
- **Define clear, achievable goals for yourself in areas you want to grow or improve.**

All my goals revolve around success, happiness, self-improvement, and leaving a positive impact on the world. I strive for self-management, achieving my ideals, continuous learning, productivity, and finding meaning in my life.

#### Explore New Interests:
- **Take time to explore new hobbies or interests that you find intriguing.**

While I tend to avoid new hobbies due to various reasons like time-wasting and discomfort, I acknowledge that stepping out of my comfort zone can lead to growth rather than stagnation.

#### Challenge Yourself:
- **Push yourself outside of your comfort zone by taking on new challenges or learning opportunities.**

I'm open to challenges, especially those I can tackle online or internally, without leaving the comfort of my home.

#### Seek Inspiration:
- **Expose yourself to inspiring stories, books, or documentaries.**

Finding inspiration can be elusive for me. Sometimes, it comes from overcoming periods of depression, self-reflection, or witnessing my family's struggles, which ignites my desire to help them. However, sustaining motivation becomes increasingly difficult as I face setbacks.

#### Reflect on Benefits:
- **Consider the long-term benefits of engaging in more beneficial activities.**

I believe that even if we fail, engaging in beneficial activities teaches us valuable lessons. For instance, despite the failure of my "tealim" application, I gained valuable insights that contribute to my growth as long as I keep learning.

#### Practice Gratitude:
- **Cultivate a mindset of gratitude by focusing on the positive aspects of your life and the opportunities available to you.**

While it's challenging due to uncertainties and other struggles, I recognize the importance of finding gratitude amidst adversity.

#### Celebrate Progress:
- **Acknowledge and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small.**

I often overlook small achievements, considering them insignificant compared to larger goals. However, I understand the importance of celebrating progress, even if it's incremental.

Let's continue this journey of self-discovery and growth together.

**Your Beloved** ***Me***
