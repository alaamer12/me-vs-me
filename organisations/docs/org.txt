this is just my thoughts to make perfect plan for our project, we have to declare everything and kill the ambiguous,

but first to kill the ambiguous u have to visualise the information, so one if the Ideas to show the information is to use documentation but not a documentation for users or developers but for us


, this documentation should show a lot of things, i will post what i remembering now:
progress
all directories
all tools
 plans [A,B,C,X]
env plans [A,B,C,X]
