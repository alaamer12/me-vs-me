# README: Directory Routes Demonstration

This README serves to demonstrate the routes within this directory.

We have a lot of tasks ahead and need to grasp a thorough understanding.

I am currently feeling confused, struggling to articulate my thoughts. It's challenging to organize my mind to execute the plans we've set.

We have various jobs:
- **Business**: This involves determining protocols, strategies, models, and related aspects such as CRM, BBM, ERP, etc.

- **Docs**: This is the central repository for documentation and plans. It will contain pages for all our needs, for internal use. It will be regularly updated to specify how each task should be done and the associated programs.

- **SMMA (Social Media Marketing Agency)**: This marks the initiation of our business on social media sites. For this, we've created two emails - Alaamer (Tealim owner) and Ahmed Muhmmed (Marketer).

- **Development**: This section will provide all the necessary resources and related elements for developing our application (programming).

- **Entrepreneurism**: This section will focus on scalability and tools to guide the app's journey from startup to full-fledged entrepreneurism.

At the moment, my thoughts are a bit scattered, but I will update this README as soon as possible and organize the necessary elements we need.
