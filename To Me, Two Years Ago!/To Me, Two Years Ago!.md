### Dear Self,

It's time for a serious conversation. We need to reignite our motivation because it's been over a week since we last felt productive. We're currently in a bit of a mess – our sleep schedule is chaotic, our mental well-being is suffering, and we feel weaker with each passing day. We've stopped practicing and even simple tasks like going upstairs exhaust us. 

Lately, we've found ourselves lacking the drive to do anything meaningful. We're spending our days playing and engaging in activities that don't contribute to our growth. This is unfamiliar territory for us. We haven't even bothered to create a schedule, and although we made a to-do list some time ago, we're struggling to follow through with it. The feeling of emptiness persists, along with existential questions about the purpose of our existence and whether we'll ever achieve success.

Loneliness weighs heavily on us, compounded by the absence of friends who share our experiences. It's frustrating to handle everything alone when there's so much on our plate – tasks to complete, knowledge to acquire, and skills to master. But deep down, I believe we can overcome these challenges. Despite feeling isolated, I hold onto the belief that every resource, every task, every endeavor contributes to our eventual success, even if it takes years to realize.

Yet, time is slipping away, and with it, our hopes diminish. I sense that we're reaching a breaking point, fearing failure this time, this year. It's becoming unbearable.

But we can't give up. Let's reconnect, realign our goals, and rediscover our purpose. We've come too far to let this setback define us. Together, we can overcome these obstacles and emerge stronger.

Looking forward to your response.

Warm regards,

**Your Beloved** ***Me***

### Hey there,

I think it's time for us to have a serious conversation about self-motivation. It's been about a week or more since we were last productive, and things are starting to feel like a mess. Our sleep schedule is off, our mental state isn't great, and I feel weaker every day. We're not practicing anything, and even simple tasks like going upstairs leave us exhausted. 

Lately, we've been feeling like we don't want to do anything productive. We're avoiding studying or working on anything meaningful, and instead, we're just playing around and doing useless things. This is a new feeling for us, and we've never been through this before. 

We haven't made a schedule, and we're not sure what to do anymore. Even though I made a to-do list a while ago, I still can't seem to get anything done. I can't shake this feeling of emptiness or the questions that keep nagging at me—why did we create all this, what is the point of living, and will I ever succeed? Do I even have to succeed, and for whom?

I can't shake this feeling of loneliness or the feeling that I don't have friends who understand me. I hate that I have to do everything by myself. There's so much to do, so much to think about, and so much to learn. I believe that I have to do all of this if I want to succeed. I believe I can do it, even if I'm pushed to do it alone. I believe that all these resources, tasks, and challenges will help me accomplish what I want, even if it takes years. I'm still hopeful that I can make it, or maybe I can't.

Time is slipping away, life is passing by, and I can feel my hope fading. I feel like I'm at the point where if I fail this time, if I fail this year, I won't be able to take it anymore.
