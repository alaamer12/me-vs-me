	 we have a lot of jobs : [Business, Docs, SMMA, Analysis, Development, Entrepreneurism]
	 
		Business: is for determines the protocols , stargies, models, and related things
		like CRM, BBM, ERP, ...etc.
		
		Docs: it will be the main container of documentations and plans,
		it will have pages for everything we needs, it will be internally use
		it will be updated regularly, 
		it will specifiy how every job should done and what its programs
		
		SMMA: it is the starting of business on Social Media sites and becuase of this
		we have created two emails [Alaamer [Tealim owner], Ahmed Muhmmed [Marketer]]
		
		Development:it will provide all need and related things of development our app [programming]
