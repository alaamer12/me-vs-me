# Activities File

This is a record of activities I perform on my personal computer (PC) or phone for reference. These are my daily activities, with some exceptions on certain days.

- **Note**: `P` stands for phone, `PC` for personal computer, and PPC indicates activities on both.
- **Note**: The time mentioned here is approximate. `~` signifies this range.
- **Note**: I use the term 'learn' for self-learning, typically referring to courses found on educational platforms like YouTube. When I mention 'study,' I am referring to academic studying for my certificate.

## ML[P]

Time spent playing Mobile Legends, which has two main modes:
- Rank: About 2-3 games per hour.
- Brawl: About 4-5 games per hour.
Note: While ML has more modes, I rarely play any others. Other modes would take similar time to Brawl.

## Games[PC]
They are the games i play on pc from day to day, usually the spent time from 30 mins to 60 mins

## Media

### Facebook[P]

Usually, time spent on Facebook is unproductive, often spent on reels. It's become a habit to use Facebook mindlessly. It's the second most distracting activity for me. To improve productivity, we should reduce time on Facebook. I use the time analysis feature on my phone to track and set time limits for apps, which has helped somewhat. However, using Facebook on PC would be more challenging to control, so I'll try to avoid it.

I have three Facebook accounts:
1. Personal account: Used for enjoyment, not related to work or productivity.
2. Organisation account: For the "Tealim" page, my future app. This account should build a small presence, an active page, feedback, and stakeholders before the app's launch.
3. Advertiser account: For advertising the "Tealim" page post-launch. This account requires a popular presence, honesty, fluency, and engagement.

The advertiser account is the most challenging, as it has many criteria to fulfill.

### Discord[PPC]

I spend time on Discord for community server interactions. I've joined many servers and have created my own, which I plan to use in the future.

### Telegram[PPC]

I also spend some time on Telegram, but unlike Discord, I'm not part of many channels or communities.

### LinkedIn[PPC]

I believe it's important to spend time on LinkedIn for career purposes, but I'm not sure how to use it effectively yet.

### Medium[PPC]

Medium is useful, but since many good stories are hidden behind a membership paywall, it's essential to utilize the platform well if I choose to pay for it. The freemium Medium account can still be valuable, so I think it's worth spending some time on.

### Twitter[PPC]

I don't use Twitter at all and don't enjoy it. However, I've noticed that it's used more formally by official accounts and organizations compared to other platforms like Facebook.

### Instagram[PPC]

I don't use Instagram personally, but some Facebook posts are linked to Instagram, so any post on Facebook will also be on Instagram.

### Threads[PPC]

Threads is a similar app to Twitter, gaining popularity upon release. However, I don't use it, especially since accounts can't be deleted, and it syncs with Facebook and Instagram.

These are the social media platforms I use, including Reddit (which I don't find beneficial). I aim to allocate time to each to make them more beneficial. It's important to determine how to engage on each platform.

The expected time spent on each medium, from most to least:
- Facebook: 60 minutes
- Discord: 45-90 minutes
- LinkedIn: 45-60 minutes
- Twitter: 45-60 minutes
- Medium: 30-60 minutes
- Telegram: 15-300 minutes

Total time ranges from 240 to 360 minutes.

### YouTube[PPC]

I use YouTube for learning and watching content. I have different accounts for each purpose: 
- Ahmedmuhmmed for learning.
- Amrmuhamed86 for entertainment.
- Alaamer for "Tealim" page-related content.

## PoS[P]

Unfortunately, this sometimes happens, and I can't ignore it. It consumes a lot of time, energy, and motivation, so I wish to stop this habit permanently.

## Browsing/Surfing[PPC]

This varies widely, as I browse for both knowledge and entertainment. I often search for:
- Bug solutions on Stack Overflow.
- Useful content on GitHub.
- Online web utilities like background removal or PDF editors.
- Exploring various websites and their services.
- Reading documentation.
- Downloading/installing software.
- General browsing on specific topics.

## Reading[PPC]

Reading about 80 pages takes about an hour, while studying those pages about 2 hours. I usually read on my phone when I'm outside, like during transportation.

## Learning[PPC]

I spend time learning from courses, which are mostly installed locally rather than on online platforms.

## Studying[PC]

Studying time varies based on the subject, difficulty, preparation, comprehension, resources, etc.

## Organizing/Maintaining[PPC]

Every month or two, I perform maintenance on my PC, which includes reorganizing files, deleting unwanted files, defragmentation, cleaning, etc. Tasks vary in time and are done manually or automatically.

Tasks include:
- Defrag (auto) [monthly]
- Check disk (auto) [monthly]
- Local backup (manual) [monthly]
- Portable backup (auto) [monthly]
- Portable backup (manual) [every two months]
- Defrag system (auto) [twice a month]
- Organize structure (manual) [twice a month]
- Cleanse temp files (manual/auto) [monthly]
- Check antivirus (auto) [weekly]
- Cleanse physically (manual) [monthly]
- Check and fix registry (auto) [monthly]
- Check drivers (every three months)
- Full Malware Scan (auto) [every two months]
- Create restore point (auto) [twice a month]


## Getting Resources[PC]

This is the time used for obtaining study/college resources. The time can vary based on what I'm searching for. For example, finding a good course could be challenging, especially if it's rare or has low content. There are many factors that could lead to low content, but this is not the place to describe them.

## Challenging[PC]

These are challenges I take on, such as speed typing, problem-solving, and projects. 
- Speed typing usually takes 10 to 15 minutes.
- Problem-solving or project work time depends on the complexity, but we can assume it's around 1 to 2 hours.

## Writing[PPC]

This is the time spent on writing, like what I'm doing in this file now. I do a lot of writing to store the information I gain or for better organization, like for this file.

## Designing

The time I spend designing or working on Photoshop and other designing tools. 
- Working takes about 1 hour.
- Designing for myself, which is rare, wouldn't exceed 30 minutes.

## These are activities not related to PC or phone that I do:

- **Grocery**: The time spent on grocery shopping varies, but usually, I go at least once a day.
  
- **Vacations**: Vacations usually last half a day, a full day, or two days. It's rare for them to exceed three days. I may go on vacation once a month.

- **Cleansing and Organizing**: This usually happens once a week when I clean my room.

- **Prayer**: Prayer can take about from one to one and half hour per day

- **Personal Life**: These are activities like sleeping, eating, drinking, showering, and healthcare.

- **Working**: I do two kinds of work: internal and external. 
  - For internal work, I usually work on Photoshop.
  - For external work, I work at the workplace. It takes about 1 hour in transportation if the road is not crowded, but it can expand to 2 hours if it is crowded, and maybe 2.5 hours if it is overcrowded. This time is the time when I arrive at work. When returning, it would take 1 to 2 hours if crowded or if there is no transportation. The actual work time varies depending on the season and day. Usually, the time spent at the workplace is about 1 to 3 hours.

## These are activities needed to be added:

- **Practice/Training**: I would like to allocate time for practice or training, so we need to free up some time for that.
