subject: You!

let's talk seriously we need to self-motivate ourself becuase i think it is been a week or a more
	since last time we were productive , we are now kinda in a mess, our sleeping-time is in a mess,
	our sane is not good, i get weaker everyday, we dont do any practice, now just for going upstairs 
	make us exhausted , we have feeling that we are want to do nothing whole day, we dont want to study
	produce or do anything than playing and do all useless things, we have not been throught this before
	we didnt till now make a schdule, we dont know what to do anymore, however i have made a to-do list
	form long time ago but i still cant do anything, i cant get rid of the feeling of emptiness
	i cant get rid of that feeling that asks me why we have created, what is the point of living,
	for what im doing it, will i ever sucess, do i have to sucess anyway and for whom.
	i cant get rid of the feeling of loneliness, i cant get rid of the feeling i dont have friends
	sharing same way as me, i hate that i have to do everything all by my own self.
	i have a lot of things to do , a lot of things to think about, a lot of things to learn
	i have to do all of this if i want to sucess this is my belife, my belife i can do it 
	even if i pushed to do it alone, my belife that those resources , those tasks, those things
	all of them will help one day to accomplish what i want if it took years, im still hopping
	i can make it, or i cant!!.
	time is being consumed, time wasted, life running, age shorted, hope fades away!!
	i feel like im at-most point of my hope that if i failed this time , that if i failed this
	year. i feel like i cant take it any more
