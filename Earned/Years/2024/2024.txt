	we have created a comprehensive accurate backlog file for tealim [over 200 rows x 11 column]
	we have get better in life
	we have got friends [previous years we were not]
	we have got respected by a few [better than nothing]
	we created different diagrams, different documents for tealim and for other things
	we have worked on MS word a lot for different purposes
	we have lost our job
	we have created comprehensive project strucutre for different projects [even games]
	we have learnt/used a bit about games and Godot
	we have earned the `eye of truth` <idiom means we have seen how big the road we have to walk through>
	we have created one of the best things through my life until now which is the `Task list`,
		in the begging i though it would be useless becuase we started by 15 tasks, but day after day
		this list has gotten bigger, has gotten bigger till it reached 1000+ tasks
		this list showed me that my days are not wastefull, they show me this by keeping tracking of
		every task i finish, i still cant belive i have created about 1000+ tasks through 65 days only
		
	also in this year i have discovered something i have been lying about, i cant do the project `tealim`
		alone, if i managed to do it on long-term it wont be good, i had to admit this
		
	but unfortunaltely, i have got team but not as enthusiastic as im, this disappointed me a bit
	
	in this year i have did a good progress through `tealim`
	
	in this year i have created different and a lot of project, some of them are public and open-sourced
		can be used in community of python
		
	this year i have got a new barillant idea about the project `snippet`
	in this year i have learnt a lot about coding, differnt shapes of code, different mindsets
		different styles, different architetures
		
	this year i have for first read a full book till its end
	in this year i have accomplished reading 4 books
	
	in this year i have become more organised
	in this year i have become more thinker about the future and plans
	in this year i have been through a lot of disappointments and disperates
	
	in this year i have become better of being muslim but not so good
	in this year i have become less introvert
	
	i still have same mental issues
	
	in this year i have discovered i have got weaker in body, i cant play football as i used to
	
	in this year i have started a health routine
	
	in this year i have did different projects in college and i have learnt things [not few or many]
	
	still no progress in any relationship
	
	im still suffer from intermittent mental health
	
	i feel like my English language and grammer has been got worse
	
	in this year i have got my first Credit card
	
	in this year i have completed my first purchase
	
	in this year i have used applications like "medium", "linkedin"

	in this year i have decided that my main programming language that im going to use is python
	
	in this year i have created my first CV however it is not so official
	
	in this year i have learnt about advanced concepts like data laking, big data, ...etc.
	
	in this year i have faced being non-wanted for any teams and wanted for different teams, i have tasted both of them
	
i think this is everything we have went through this year, it may appear that bad things
	are little but they were too affected on me, the depression put me down for many days
	without able to do anything several times
	
i cant say this year was the perfect year [based on me not the world or the other] but we have learnt a lot through this year
im apprecating everything and everyone helped me through this year
