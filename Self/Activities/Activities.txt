this is activities file which i do on pc or of the pc or on phone for trace back
they are just the activities i do daily
**Knowing** That some days have exceptions
Note: `P` for phone , `PC` for personal computer, PPC means Phone and PC 
Note: the mentioned time here is approxmateliy, `~` means in this range approxmateliy
Note: that i use `learn` verb to mention to self-learning that are usually courses we find
	on eductional platfroms like youtube, but when i mention `study` i mean the studying for 
	college that is our certificate
	i mean by 'watch' verb here is that the time i watch series and movies 

	ML[P]: it is the time spent on mobile legends game, mobile legends has two main modes 
		i play[rank and brawl]
		rank takes about 2~3 games for 1 hour
		brawl takes about 4~5 games for 1 hour
		Note: ML has more than those two modes but im rarely play any other modes
			and usually any other mode will take hardly the same time that brawl 
			mode will take so u can consider when i mention brawl i mean 
			any other mode rather than rank
			
	Games[PC]: They are the games i play on pc from day to day,
		usually the spent time from 30 mins to 60 mins
		
	Media:
		Facebook[P]: usually the spent time on Facebook are useless and usually this time 
			were on reels and it becomes a happit to use Facebook mindless,
			Facebook considered to be the 2nd most distracted activity i do, so we need to
			detract it before it is getting worse and for better productivity
			we also need to calculate the time spent on it to make ideal for us 
			the only way to calculate the time spent on Facebook is the time analysis 
			built in my phone which can show the time spent with each app through a day
			or a week, also it can set time out for some apps which would be benfcial 
			and it is kinda solved the problem but still there is something more, like 
			what if i become to use facebook on pc, we would need a solution for this
			this is would make it harder so i will try to not transform Facebook into 
			`PPC` use
			
			Truthfully, actually we have a lot to do on Facebook, we have three accounts
				for Facebook[personal account, organisation account, advertiser account]
				all of those account are at initial stage, which means they still dont have 
				a presence, charisma, stamina <Metophorically>, and so
				
				for personal account, it is the account we enjoy engage on it like seeing some
					posts or reels, it is just the account we enjoy to use and dont relate to any 
					work/job or any productivity
					
				for organisation account, it is the account for `tealim` page which it is the future app of mine,
					this account should create at least small presence, active page, feedbacks, and stakeholders
					before its launch
					
				for advertiser account, it is the account to advertise for `tealim` page when it is launched
					this account should have a lot of acquaintances, popular presence, truthfully account,
					honest person,fluent talking, active personal page and engagable person
				
				so far the advertiser account would be the most challenging account,
				it has many criteria to fulfill
				
		Discord[PPC]: we need to give some time for it for building revolution in community servers
			we have already joined a lot of community servers and we even a did our own server
			which we would use it in the future but not now 
			
		Telegram[PPC]: we need to give it also some time, but unlike discord Telegram doesnt have
			many channels or communities we are joined in as Discord
			
		Linkedin[PPC]: i think it is important to give it a time for career and so, but actually im 
			still dont know what to do on it or what to post
			
		Medium[PPC]: Medium is useful application but becuase of member access only usually 
			good stories are hidden. However, Medium monthly price is not expensive it is 
			about 100LE. but this is up to me, so i have to make sure that the time i gonna pay
			i should utilize it and benfit from it.
			However freemium Medium account can still be valuable, so i think we should 
			give it some time
		Twitter[PPC]: im actually dont use twitter at all and i dont like it, i dont 
			enjoy using this app and i dont care to others twitts, but i have found out 
			that twitter is being used as more formally for offcial accounts and organisations
			like u may found an offical account of organisations `X` but maybe u wont find it 
			also on other social media platforms like Facebook
			
		Instagram[PPC]: i dont use Instagram and i find it useless but some accounts of Facebook
			will be linked on Instagram too, so usually any post goes to Facebook will go Instagram
			i wont specify any time for Instagram, but i only wanted to say they will be in sync
			
		Threads[PPC]: is similar app for Twitter, which gain a lot of popularity once it is released
			but i dont use it and i wont use it specially the accounts cant be deleted
			and it is from Facebook so Threads and Instagram and Facebook are in sync
			and deleting ur account on Threads mean delete it everywhere
			becuase sync is not an option in Threads
			
		i think those are all social media i use in addition to `Reddit` [i dont see it benfcial]
			some of them are distracted and some of them are benfcial, but what i want is to give
			every one of them a time off so it could be always benfcial,
			also we need to determine how would we engage in every medium
			
		i think this would be the expected arrangement of the most spend 
			time medium till the least:
				Facebook [60 mins]
				Discord [45 mins ~ 90 mins]
				Linkedin [45 mins ~ 60 mins]
				Twitter [45 mins ~ 60 mins]
				Medium [30 mins ~ 60 mins]
				Telegram [15 mins ~ 300 mins]
				
				so total time will be ranged in [240 mins ~ 360 mins]
		
	YouTube[PPC]: is divided into many partitions but usually it is being used for 
		learing sessions and watching sessions 
		i use YouTube for many things but this things i watch based on the acount i use
		where i specified each activity i do on youtube with account
		for learing i use `ahmedmuhmmed` account, for watching i use `amrmuhamed86`
		for getting `tealim` page i use account `alaamer`
		
	PoS[P]: i hate to admit it but this is sometimes happen which i cant ignore 
		it and it costs alot of time , power and motivation , so im just wishing to 
		stop this one time and forever
		
	browsing/surfing[PPC]: this is actually can not be defined because it is in general 
		case when i am browsing on internet, sometimes i browse for 
		knowledge, sometimes browse for fun like to watch movies
		this are the most things i search about:
			seeking for help with a bug i found like on stackoverflow
			explore useful content on github
			use some web utils online like background remove, pdf online editor
			trying to figure out or check from somewhat website and see what service it provide
			learning on some docs sites
			trying to download/install something
			browse on specific thing
			this what i can think i do it for now
			
	reading[PPC]: usually the time take to read about 80 pages is 1 hour while the 
		time to study those is about 1~2 hours study,
		usually the time i read on the phone is when im outside at somewhat transportation
		
	learing[PPC]: is the time when i learn from courses thoses courses are usually
		or by 95% installed on local machines, and not on online platforms
		becuase we prefere the course to be installed locally
		
	studying[PC]: this time is hard to be knowm because it is the time i study for 
		college and this is depend on several factors like 
		what subject i study , how hard or depth it is , am i late in studying, 
		is it smoothly understandable, subject resources, ...etc.
		
	organising/maintaining[PPC]: from time to time like for every month or two month 
		i do some maintenance for the pc , like i reorganize the files and folder, 
		delete un wanted files defrag, clean it from inside and outsids , ...etc.
		the time differs from each task i do , some tasks are long like check desk,
		some tasks are quick like organise structure but most of 
		them are long time tasks
		also some of those tasks are done manually and some are done automatically 
		but i think most of them are done automatically
		i think the tasks we do is:
			defrag [auto] [once a month]
			check desk [auto] [once a month]
			local backup [manually] [once a month]
			portable backup [auto] [once a month]
			portable backup [manually] [once for two months]
			defrag system [auto] [twice a month]
			organise structure [manually] [twice a month]
			cleansing temp files [manually/auto] [once a month]
			check antivirus [auto] [once a week]
			cleansing physically [manually] [once a month]
			check and fix registry [auto] [once a month]
			check drivers [once for three months]
			full Malware Scan [auto] [once for two months]
			create restore point [auto] [twice a month]
			
	getting resources[PC]: it is the time used for getting study/college resources
		this time can differ based on the something im searching about, like to find 
		good course could be hard or even if u are searching about something specifically
		and it could be more chellenging if it is rare thing to search or with low content
		there are many factor would lead to low content but here is not the place to describe them
		
	challenging[PC]: challenges i do, it could be speed-typing problem solving, projects
		if it is speed-typing it would usually take from 10 mins to 15 mins
		if it is problem solving or projects it depends on the complexity
		i think we can assume like 1 to 2 hours
		
	writting[PPC]: the time spent on writting, like the time i write in this file now, 
		i do alot of writting this is becuase to store the information i gain or for
		more organising like for this file
		
	Phtotoshop: the time i spent desgining or working on the photoshop
		if it is working it would take more/less 1 hour
		if i desgin for myself and this is rarely it wouldnt exceed 30 mins

Those are activities not related to PC or Phone but i do it
	grocery: it cant be determined how would be the time i go for grocery, but usually
		everyday i go for grocery at least once a time
		
	vactions: the vactions usually are half a day, 1 day and half, or two days but it is rarely if it 
		exceeded the third day, maybe i go to vaction once a month

	working: i do two kinds of working[internally, externally]
		for internally, i usually work on Photoshop as i have mentioned before
		for externally, i usually work on the workplace, this workplace can take about
		1 hour in transportations if the road is not crowded, but it would expand to 2 hours
		if the is crowded and maybe 2.5 hours if overcrowded
		this time is the time when i go to the work[arrival time], but when returning back
		it would take 1 hour to 2 hours if crowded or there is no transportations
		
		but the actual work time vary depending on the season and day, 
		early season mean much work
		usually the time spent at workplace is about 1 to 3 hours
