the perfect day:
	this data from my point of view [reminds 24]
	i think it is idealy to make the day start from 6-7 or at sunshine
		and	ends the day at 9:30 to 11 or before midnight by while [reminds 16~15]
	i think it is good if u practice typing like about 30 mins or less
		to enhance ur writting skills [reminds 15:30~14:30]
	i think it is good if u listened[watched] some useful content as courses
		from 3 - 4 hours of courses per day [reminds 11:30~10:30]
	i think it is good if u spent 2 - 3 hours  practical time [reminds 8:30~7:30]
	i think it is good if u spent 80 pages of a book daily and reading the book 
		takes about 1 hour and keep tracking and understanding take about
		another hour [reminds 6:30~6]
	if we calculated the time used for eating , and other affairs we can give it 
		2 - 3 hours [reminds 4~3]
	usually we take a break after a while like after studing for 2 hours or less
		and usually the break is 30 mins, but if we calculated the total break time
		about 5 - 6 break time [reminds 2~1:30]
	if we defined the error in calculations as 1 - 2 hours [reminds 0~0]
	
	by that we have finished useful 24 hours, this guide assumes standard normal conditions
	NOTE THIS GUIDE IS UN-SORTED
	
	
**standard normal conditions [SNC]**:
	is the person has no outer activites[e.g. hanging out], not injuired, not sick, doesnt
		have obiligations to someone or something, is totally free of obiligations,
		
	
Note:
	it is hard to make a guide if one of the SNC has failed,
	to make such a guide we need first to know which condition has failed
	here is my expectations:
		if external activites:
			we need to know the exact time , also we need to add a rest time which i expect
			wont be less than 3 hours
		else if injuiries or illness:
			this is not the most hurmful case , but due to that , maybe the sleeping time
			and breaks will increase and it can increase to over 4 hours
		else if obiligate to something [not choiceable]:
			this is would make ur obiligations the top pirority which will lead to dispense with
			a role in the guide
		else if obiligate to something [choiceable]:
			this is may decrease the obiligations [not choiceable] pirority but it is still
			an obiligation, which wont be best practice if u avoided it
		else:
			it is hard to tell if there is another reason other than those reasons[conditions]
			in SWC , so u would have to man-up
