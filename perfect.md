# The Perfect Day Guide

## Introduction
The following guide outlines an ideal day from my perspective, consisting of various activities and time allocations.
### **Note:**
- ##### Creating an accurate schedule relies on understanding these symbols and their implications for precise time management.
- The `-` is used between two times to denote the interval.
- The `~` is used between two times to indicate an approximate interval.


## Schedule Highlights:
- **Morning Routine:**
  - Begin the day between 6:00 - 7:00 AM or at sunrise.
  - The day ending routine by 9:30 - 11:00 PM or before midnight.

- **Skill Enhancement:**
  - Dedicate about 30 minutes or less to typing practice, improving writing skills (15:30 ~ 14:30).

- **Learning Time:**
  - Invest 3 - 4 hours in watching or listening to educational content, such as courses (11:30 ~ 10:30).

- **Practical Application:**
  - Allocate 2 - 3 hours for hands-on practical work (8:30 ~ 7:30).

- **Reading Session:**
  - Aim to read 80 pages of a book daily, with an estimated time of 2 hours, including tracking and understanding (6:30 ~ 6:00).

- **Daily Responsibilities:**
  - Factor in 2 - 3 hours for eating and attending to other personal affairs (4:00 ~ 3:00).

- **Breaks:**
  - Take breaks after every 2 hours of study, each lasting approximately 30 minutes. A total of 5 - 6 breaks throughout the day (2:00 ~ 1:30).

- **Error Margin:**
  - Account for 1 - 2 hours of potential errors in time calculations (0:00).

## Completion of 24 Hours
By adhering to this schedule under standard normal conditions, a productive and fulfilling 24-hour day is achieved. Please note that this guide is unsorted.

## Standard Normal Conditions [SNC]:
This guide assumes the individual has:
- No external activities (e.g., hanging out)
- No injuries or illnesses
- No obligations to someone or something ***internally***
- Complete freedom from obligations ***externally***


**Note:**
Creating a guide becomes challenging if any of the SNC fails. To develop a tailored plan, it's crucial to identify which condition is not met. Here are the expectations for different scenarios:

- **External Activities:**
  - If engaged in external activities, precise timing is needed. Additionally, factor in a rest time, expected to be no less than 3 hours.

- **Injuries or Illness:**
  - While not the most harmful case, it may lead to an increase in sleeping time and breaks, potentially exceeding 4 hours.

- **Obligation (Not Choiceable):**
  - Having obligations as the top priority will require omitting a role in the guide.

- **Obligation (Choiceable):**
  - While this may decrease the priority of non-choiceable obligations, it is still considered an obligation. Avoiding it is not the best practice.

- **Other Unforeseen Reasons:**
  - If there are reasons beyond the listed conditions, it becomes challenging to provide specific guidance under SNC. In such cases, adaptability is key, and adjustments may be necessary.

Remember, adhering to the guide under Standard Normal Conditions is the ideal scenario. However, flexibility and adaptability are essential for real-life variations.```
