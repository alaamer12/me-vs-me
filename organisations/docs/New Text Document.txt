		those are the things the have been told in the seminar , but we want the bullets for ourseleves
		so those are the most important things have been told in it:
			taking a long or hardcore road actually isnt a bad idea, becuase it can centrilze ur self
			also not all can finish this long way , only the hardworkers and patients can do it
			
			u have to think more at ur area not in global area , u have to think more at best way 
			for future even if it is harder or longer
			
			u have to gain experience and the experience is gained from interaction even if u dont like 
			to have a boss , but this is helping u to know how the real scenarios happen in real life
			
			failing at something does not always means the lack of ur ability, sometimes people look
			for more the qualification or abilities but they look from where u came ur look, gender and so 
			
			nothing starts big , but u have to think big , u have to put logically plan not just going with wind
			
			its recommended to take one track not more and focuse on it
