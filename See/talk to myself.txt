Talk to me amr, what is your problem
what are your hopes
what is the future you want for yourself, just yourself

i feel terible i feel ugly i hate my face i hate that others have to look at me
i dont feel even if i tried to wear good clothes, healthier life,.....i dont think i will get prettier
i still feel i will look ugly, as they said putting good clothes on a monkey wont make it pretty

my face was and still an obstacle of my confidence specially when i talk to a girl
it is like i feel sorry to have her to look at me 
it is like i feel sorry to be born like that
i know im not the ugliest but i still feel like that
i think this issue comes from my childhood, i have got builed alot at that time
and i think this is why im introvert, i was not able to show my face for long time
i wont lie my life is get healthier but i still feel this is meaningless

i have always wanted to be more handsome
i have always wanted to not be loved for material things such as money
i have always wanted to be loved just as like im not because of green bills

this problem about not being loved, about ugliness have went be to bad behaviours
such as hating myself, mastrubation, ...etc.


i think it is impossible to have better face, or at least for my relgion
i hope to be succesful, i hope to gain money enough to show apprecation for every one has been nice
to me, i hope to leave my country, i hope to have more beutiful life, i hope to be better muslim
i hope to have better knowledge

-- Updated
I love myself
i dont hate my face no longer
i will be better
